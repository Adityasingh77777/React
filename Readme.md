  - useEffect Hook
  - Component Lifecycle
  - Custom Hooks
  - Lifting State Up
  - Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
  - Passing Functions as Props

- **Project Structure & Tools**
  - Using Vite for fast React development
  - Organizing code into folders and components
  - Using .gitignore to manage project files
  - Using ESLint for code quality

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Notes
- Each folder contains a separate mini-project or concept demonstration.
- You can explore each topic by navigating to the respective folder and running the code.
